1. Overview
  *********
  Learning colours are basic features for every kids. Therefore, some parents are having trouble to teach their Kids
  recognizing the colours. Hence, matching colours are the best way for children to remember their colours. In this game,
  there are eleven basic colours, for instance, Pink, Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, White, Brown, Black, Grey and Blue.

  This is a matching clours game, children are asking to drag the right colour balls into the right colour basket.
  From Level1 to level 12, the number of colour basket are increasing from 1 to 4, each basket have its own colour.
  The colours of baskets are randomizing between 11 colours. From level 5, the number of baskets still remaining 4 but
  there may be some movement of balls or baskets.

  To encourage the kids to remember each colours as much as they can I am thinking about the scores of each level to increase
  whenever the kids play that level again and again.
